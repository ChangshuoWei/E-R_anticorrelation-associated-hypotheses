We tested the E-R anticorrelation in ten viurses and did not observe an E-R anticorrealtion in these viurses. Furthermore, the E-R anticorrelation still exists when viruses were integrated into the genome of host cells and purifying selection against cytotoxicity was restored. These observations challenge the maintenance of protein function as a major constraint on protein sequence evolution in cellular organisms.
This code includes all the code to generate the figures in the paper entitled:"The missing expression level-evolutionary rate anticorrelation in viruses does not support protein function as a main constraint on sequence evolution".
